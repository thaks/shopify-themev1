  This file is intentionally left blank!

  It exists solely to create an alternate "ajax" view for the index page, which can be used along with the Section Rendering API to defer rendering of non-critical content so that it can be added in later using an AJAX request without incurring additional cost to the initial server response time. An example of this is shown in the "product-grid-toggle" module.
